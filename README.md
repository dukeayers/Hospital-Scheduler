Hospital-Scheduler
==================

Creating a web app that will be able to schedule teams of doctors and nurses to effectively organize their schedules



BootStrap Guides
==================
Lynda.com offers a great BootStrap guide - preferably BootStrap 3 (not the advanced version)
    - Doing all of the exercises will greatly increase your knowledge of BootStrap


PHP
==================
Lynda.com is also another great resource but I have not done the full tutorial on it.


JavaScript/jQuery
==================
I recommend you have a basic understanding of these two languages before you attempt AngularJS. The order of learning them should be jQuery and then JavaScript.


AngularJS
==================
The best way to learn AngularJS is through the thinkster.io website - choose the beginner's guide. If you want a free e-book to read with this framework then I would suggest going
to the following link and downloading the book: http://it-ebooks.info/book/2076/


Exercises
==================
If you want a good jQuery/JavaScript/BootStrap exercise then I would recommend creating a simple calculator.
I will update this when I find a good AngularJS Exercise.
