Hospital-Scheduler
==================

Creating a web app that will be able to schedule teams of doctors and nurses to effectively organize their schedules



BootStrap Guides
==================
Lynda.com offers a great BootStrap guide - preferably BootStrap 3 (not the advanced version)
    - Doing all of the exercises will greatly increase your knowledge of BootStrap


PHP
==================
Lynda.com is also another great resource but I have not done the full tutorial on it.


JavaScript/jQuery
==================
I recommend you have a basic understanding of these two languages before you attempt AngularJS. The order of learning them should be jQuery and then JavaScript.


AngularJS
==================
The best way to learn AngularJS is through the thinkster.io website - choose the beginner's guide. If you want a free e-book to read with this framework then I would suggest going
to the following link and downloading the book: http://it-ebooks.info/book/2076/


Exercises
==================
If you want a good jQuery/JavaScript/BootStrap exercise then I would recommend creating a simple calculator.
I will update this when I find a good AngularJS Exercise.


Current Database Schema
==================
Fill the data up with whatever information you want...

####DB Name: 
Scheduler

####Table: 
Personnel

####Columns:
Personnel_ID

Personnel_First_Name

Personnel_Last_Name

Personnel_Email

Personnel_Mobile

Personnel_Password

Personnel_Hours_Scheduled


Database Filler Text
==================

There is an excel sheet that is included with the data. All you need to do is download the excel sheet to your desktop and then once inside of phpmyadmin, you can import the data.
The data must stay as a .csv file, please do not change this.
